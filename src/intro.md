# Introduction

While interest in parallel computing has increased significantly in the past few decades, its roots stretch deep into the past.
In fact, *parallel computating itself* started as a method of organizing humans.
As early as the 1700s, institutions employed human workers as "computers", charging them with the painstaking task of mass calculation and regimenting their process to streamline performance.

With the advent of modern computers, people now have fast and reliable devices to calculate for them, but telling these devices what to do is tricky. On top of this, people have found computers to be significantly more useful when they can communicate and collaborate with one-another, but telling them how to effectively work together is even harder.


## Who this Book is For

This book is here to provide a framework for people to understand and apply parallel computing.
This book assumes that you have some experience with systems programming, though some review of systems concepts is provided to help frame discussion.


## How to Read this Book

This book is intended to be read (mostly) sequentially, but is also structured to act as a quick reference for your future parallel endeavors. If you are not reading this book for the Parallel Computing course at Seattle University, you may feel free to skip the [Course Practices](./practices/intro.md) section.

If you read this book non-sequentially, it is nonethless reccomended your read a chapter's main page before reading its subchapters. These main pages are provided to introduce the chapter's premise and organization.
