# Collecting Data
[slide](./collecting_intro.md)

Software rarely behaves exactly as expected during development. That's why software developers write tests to double-check the correctness of their code.
That is also why it's important to test the performance of software as different parallelization strategies are applied.

Factors such as the amount of data processed, the resources allocated, or the distribution of work can affect the speed of a program.
With performance metrics, the relationship between a program's inputs and its processing throughput can be better understood.
Furthermore, when performance trends defy expectations, they reveal misunderstandings about the tested software.
