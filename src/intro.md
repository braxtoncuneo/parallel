# Introduction

Over the past century, computing has reshaped our world dramatically.
With the advent of modern computers, we have fast and reliable devices to process data, but we are now faced with the challenge of understanding them.

As many software developers can attest, while computers are powerful, getting them to behave properly is tricky.
With parallel programming, both the hazards and the potential of computing is magnified.

Want to make software faster?
More responsive?
More efficient?
Want to understand the technology supporting the devices you use every day?
Want to work on the forefront of computing technology?

If so, we invite you to learn with us in the subject of parallel computing. 

## Who this Book is For

This book is here to provide a framework for people to understand and apply parallel computing.
This book assumes that you have some experience with systems programming, though some review of systems concepts is provided to help frame discussion.
This book also assumes that you know C++, which will be used for most included code snippets.
Some other programming languages are shown, but in-depth knowledge of them isn't crucial.



## How to Read this Book

This book is ordered to approximate the order subjects will be covered in the course, but it is also structured as a quick reference.
Feel free to read wherever your curiosity takes you.

This book is a living document, so parts may change, appear, or disappear as the term progresses or as the course is refined.

If you are not reading this book for the Parallel Computing course at Seattle University, you may feel free to skip the [Course Practices](./practices/intro.md) section.
