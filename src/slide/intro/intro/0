# Laying Groundwork

Parallelism in software is closely tied with the fine details of how software is executed. To lay a solid foundation for our understanding, this chapter covers computer architecture and the ideas developed by computer scientists to abstract over its complexity.

## Chapter Structure

- [Computers in a Nutshell](./computers.md) - An overview of how computers work
- [Models of Parallelism](./models) - Ways of thinking about parallelism
- [Problems with State](./state.md) - Why some computer scientists really like functional programming
- [Laws of Computer Power](./laws.md) - How parallelism affects programs
