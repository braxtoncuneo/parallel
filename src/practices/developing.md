# Developing Software

## The CS1 Server

The software that you submit for this course (with the exception of software that uses GPUs) will be evaluated based upon how it runs on Seattle University's CS1 server.

Though it is not required to develop your code on CS1, it is strongly recommended that you do so. Here are some big reasons why:
- All CPU-oriented APIs covered in this course are supported by CS1. No installation required.
- If you are working on the same system as everybody else, the problems you encounter will likely be similar to other students'. This makes it easier for instructors and TAs when they are helping you during office hours.
- Developing on CS1 significantly reduces the possibility that the code you submit breaks unexpectedly when it is being graded.
- All CPU-oriented projects submitted for this course will be submitted on CS1, so developing on CS1 saves you the trouble of copying over files and making sure line endings are in the proper UNIX format.


## Choice of Language

The software projects required by this course involve the use of specific techniques/APIs.
This course will focus upon the application of these tools with C++ and C++-adjacent languages such as CUDA/OpenCL.

Most projects will require you to develop your software with a specific language.
If this is the case, the language will be detailed in the project description.

If you wish to implement your project using a language that's different from the project description, talk with me about it.
If the requested language looks like a good fit for the project, I may approve its use on a case-by-case basis.
Keep in mind that I don't plan to approve languages that trivialize the challenge of projects.
Furthermore, if you request to use a certain language, you accept the responsibility of any increased difficulty associated with that language.

The software that you submit for this course (with the exception of software that uses GPUs) will be evaluated based upon how it runs on Seattle University's CS1 server.

It's strongly recommended you develop on CS1 because:

- It has all the things you need (for CPU programs)
- Your development problems will be similar to everyone else's
- It greatly reduces the chance of programs magically breaking upon submission
- You won't have to worry about migrating files

# Choice of Language

<div style="font-size: 1.5em;">

This course will primarily use C++ and C++-adjacent languages such as CUDA/OpenCL, and most projects will require you to develop in a specific language.

If you wish to implement your project using a language that's different from the project description, talk with me about it.

If the requested language looks like a good fit for the project, I may approve or deny its use on a case-by-case basis.
