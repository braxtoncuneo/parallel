### Taking the Maximum

The processing power of a system is limited, and must be divided across concurrently acting threads.
This means that intense processor usage by other processes can negatively effect the performance of a program, however we want to measure only the effects of the program's inputs/techniques.




Luckily, this form of error one can only reduce performance {{footnote: Imagine if a process got *faster* when other process hogged CPU time}}, so the maximum sample should approach the true speedup as the number of samples increases.
Below, the python script previously shown is modified to take the maximum of multiple samples. 


````admonish example title="Example: A Revised Collection Script"


Here is a revised version of the collection script that uses

```python
{{#include ../../../practices/multi_sample_collector.py}}
```

The script's output:

```console
<!-- cmdrun g++ ../../../practices/collected.cpp -o my_program.exe;  python3 ../../../practices/multi_sample_collector.py -->
```
