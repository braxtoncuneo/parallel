# Random Access Memory (Supplemental)

While we are brushing up on computer architecture, you may want to review the finer points of memory.
We will be applying memory-related concepts in this course, including pointers.

[Here's a slideshow from my CPSC 1430 course material.](./Memory.pdf)

The slide show does not cover void or function pointers, since it is aimed at lower-level CS students.
I suggest you independently read up on them, if they are not familiar to you.


<!--
## Void Pointers

### What is `void`?











### Why Use Void Pointers?





## Function Pointers

### The Basics


### The Rabbit Hole of Type Signatures in C/C++



### The Connection to Instructions in Memory
