# Showing Data

A major component of this course is investigating and presenting performance data.
A portion of your project grades will be evaluated based upon the quality of your data, your presentation of that data, and your analysis of that data.

## Table Conventions
### Labeling and Units

Tables of data should:
- have a header
- label its rows and columns according the the value of the corresponding independent variable
- label its row and column axes to describe the variables depicted
- show units for data as well as row/column labels

As long as the table header clearly states the units for the data presented, individual cells do not need to be labeled with units.

### Significant Figures

Tables of data should provide a reasonable number of significant figures.

Too many significant figures can make them difficult to read and may imply precision that doesn't exist.
Too few significant figures makes interpretation more difficult.
As a general rule, having between 3 and 6 significant figures should be fine. With very low values, fewer than 3 significant figures is also reasonable.


```admonish example title="Example: A Well-Labelled Table with a Reasonable Number of Significant Figures"

```


## Graphing Conventions 


### Labelling
Graphs should:
- have a title
- should label its axes and provide corresponding units
- should label its trend lines with its corresponding values
- should provide units for trend lines either with a legend title or in the title/subtitle of the graph


### Visual Clarity
Graphs should:
- scale axes to aid interpretation, avoiding overlapping trend lines
- not use line smoothing on trendlines, as this implies extra data points that do not exist
- use good quality data with little noise. Taking the maximum of samples can help with this.


```admonish example title="Example: A Decent Graph"
![A plot of the data collected with multiple samples per point. The trend-lines look smooth.](multi.png "The Data with Multiple Samples Per Point")
```


## Showing Your Work 

When making claims about data, we often discuss the results of calculations.
While showing your work is not required for large collections of data, you are expected to at least show the equations/formulae you used to perform your calculations.
For small collections of data, you are expected to show your work.
