# Developing Software

## The CS1 Server

The software that you submit for this course (with the exception of software that uses GPUs) will be evaluated based upon how it runs on Seattle University's CS1 server.

Though it is not required to develop your code on CS1, it is strongly reccomended that you do so. Here are some big reasons why:
- All CPU-oriented APIs covered in this course are supported by CS1. No installation required.
- If you are working on the same system as everybody else, the problems you encounter will likely be similar to other students'. This makes it easier for instructors and TAs when they are helping you during office hours.
- Developing on CS1 significantly reduces the possibility that the code you submit breaks unexpectedly when it is being graded.
- All CPU-oriented projects submitted for this course will be submitted on CS1, so developing on CS1 saves you the trouble of copying over files and making sure line endings are in the proper UNIX format.
